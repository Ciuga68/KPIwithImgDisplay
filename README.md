# KPIwithImgDisplay
My first extension from scratch. there are many kpi extensions availbale but wanted to build one for the specific purpose for current project at work. Currently using it into Qlik Sense mashup and thought to share it with the community.

Please feel free to reach out to me for any issue or usage of the extension.

Currently working and learning to add more features into extension.

I have tried my best to follow best practice and coding technics. Please suggest if there are any better way to achieve same.

Extension is not using any third party library. It is completly made up of, html, css and javascript.
